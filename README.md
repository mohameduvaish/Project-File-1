# Credit Risk Prediction with SHAP Explainability

This project builds and explains a machine learning model for **credit risk prediction**, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent and interpretable insights about how features influence model decisions.

The goal is to help understand **why** a borrower is classified as high-risk or low-risk, ensuring fairness, transparency, and trust in automated decision-making systems.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Loads the `credit_risk.csv` dataset  
- Handles missing values  
- Encodes categorical variables  
- Splits data into train/test sets  

### 2️⃣ Model Training
A machine learning classifier (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost depending on the notebook) is used to predict credit default risk.

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation
The notebook reports key metrics such as:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  

These help evaluate overall predictive performance.

### 4️⃣ Explainability with SHAP
SHAP is used to provide interpretability:

#### 🔹 Global Interpretability
- `shap_summary_plot.png`  
  - Shows the most important features affecting model predictions  
  - Highlights direction (positive/negative) and magnitude of influence  

#### 🔹 Local Interpretability
- Individual-level SHAP values (from `shap_values_output.csv`)  
  - Explain why a specific person was classified high-risk or low-risk  
  - Useful for fairness and regulatory compliance

## 📊 Outputs

All important outputs generated by the notebook include:

- **Global SHAP Summary Plot**
- **SHAP Values CSV**
- **Model performance metrics**
- **Confusion matrix visualizations** (if included in notebook)
- **Written interpretation in `report.md`**

## 🧠 Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates:

- How credit risk models operate  
- How explainability tools (SHAP) help interpret model predictions  
- How to identify important risk factors  
- How to justify model decisions to stakeholders and auditors  

This is crucial in financial applications where decisions must be transparent and accountable.
